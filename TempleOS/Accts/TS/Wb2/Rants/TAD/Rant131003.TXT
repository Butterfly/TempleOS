God said the best religion is the one with the most new vistas of understanding over a lifetime -- the one you can level-up the most in.

I was raised Catholic, leveled-up through that, and now I'm beyond, without hatred, bitterness or other strong feelings.  Communion is a sacrament of initiation.  I guess it's food for thought, LOL.

$FG,4$9:21 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it
with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was
as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that
descended out of the mount.

9:22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye
provoked the LORD to wrath.

9:23 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up
and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against
the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor
hearkened to his voice.

9:24 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew
you.

9:25 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as
I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy
you.$FG$

The last time I went to church (2002), I walked-out because I was annoyed by the priest being a drama queen and walking slowly around the altar.  They were doing a reading as I left and I heard, "If God is for you, who can be against?"

This is the parable of the sower.  Rich soil is intelligent people.

Back in 2004, I read Linux code to find-out how to do IDE ATA PIO.  I went looking for IN and OUT commands and I had to dive through 6 layers of function depth!  Also, they had these crazy stupid #define macros to make C look like C++.  They had #ifdefs that made it ugly, too.

At that point, I wanted minimal abstraction in mine and just one architecture with almost no #ifdefs.

Just now, I added this, reluctantly.  Using this stupid function forces people to look-up code:


$HL,1$Bool IsEditableText(CDocEntry *doc_e)
{
  if (doc_e->type_u8==DOCT_TEXT&&
    !(doc_e->flags1&DOCEG1_DONT_EDIT)&&!(doc_e->flags2&DOCEG2_DONT_EDIT))
    return TRUE;
  else
    return FALSE;

I wrote a text editor in 2004 with a circular doubly-linked list for lines.  It was called an LTF, linked-text-file.  The nodes became commands, not complete lines.  Then, I added graphics.
