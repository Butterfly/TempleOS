TempleOS is an $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"x86_64","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64#AMD64"$$FG$, multi-tasking, multi-cored, public domain, open source, $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"ring-0-only","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(computer_security)"$$FG$, single-address-map ($FG,4$$TX+HTML,"identity-mapped","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(mathematics)"$$FG$), non-networked, PC operating system for recreational programming.

A troll might ask, "Why not just use $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"DOS","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS"$$FG$?  It was ring-0-only and single-address-map."  Actually, they wouldn't because many people would say, "Cool idea!  I'm gonna dust-off $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"DOS","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS"$$FG$ right now and have some fun!"  $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"DOS","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS"$$FG$ is 16-bit with segmentation, though, which is awful.  TempleOS is 64-bit, flat, non-segmented and multi-cored.  It's like a modern, souped-up, multi-tasking, cross between $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"DOS","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS"$$FG$ and a Commodore 64.  It has a C64-like shell with a $LK,"dialect","FI:::/TempleOS/Doc/Differences.TXT"$ of C/C++ instead of BASIC.  It was written from scratch, and not even ASCII was sacred -- it has 8-bit unsigned character source code to support European languages.  Also, the source code has graphics.

A troll might say, "But, it can crash!"  We all used $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"DOS","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS"$$FG$ for years and loved it. Computers even had a reset switch!  Just think of the power of ring-0, muhahaha! Think of the speed and simplicity of $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"ring-0-only","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(computer_security)"$$FG$ and $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"identity-mapping","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(mathematics)"$$FG$.  It's only $LK+D,"139,639","FF:::/TempleOS/Accts/TS/Wb2/LineCnt.TXT,Kernel.PRJ","DD_TEMPLEOS_LOC"$ lines of code, including the compiler and can change tasks in half a microsecond because it doesn't mess with page tables or privilege levels.  Inter-process communication is effortless because every task can access every other task's memory.

It's fun having access to everything.  When I was a teenager, I had a book, $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"Mapping the Commodore 64","http://unusedino.de/ec64/technical/project64/mapping_c64.html"$$FG$, that told what every location in memory did.  I liked copying the ROM to RAM and poking around at the ROM BASIC's variables.  Everybody directly poked the hardware ports.

TempleOS is simpler than Linux and you can have hours of fun tinkering because all memory and ports are accessible.  Memory is $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"identity-mapped","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(mathematics)"$$FG$ at all times, so you can modify any task's memory from any other task.  You can access all disk blocks, too.  I had a blast using a C64 disk block editor to modify directories to un-delete files, when I was a kid.  Maybe, you want to play with a raw-block database, or make your own file system?

I wrote all $LK+D,"139,639","FF:::/TempleOS/Accts/TS/Wb2/LineCnt.TXT,Kernel.PRJ","DD_TEMPLEOS_LOC"$ lines of TempleOS over the last $TX+D,"9.6","DD_TEMPLEOS_AGE"$ years, full-time.  It was called, at various times, "$FG,4$$TX+HTML,"Hoppy","http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.simstructure.hare.com/*"$$FG$", "$FG,4$$TX+HTML,"The J Operating System","http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://www.justrighteous.org/*"$$FG$", "$FG,4$$TX+HTML,"LoseThos","http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.losethos.com/*"$$FG$" and "$FG,4$$TX+HTML,"SparrowOS","http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.sparrowos.com/*"$$FG$".  Here are my $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"college transcripts","http://www.templeos.org/files/ASU_Transcripts.pdf"$$FG$.  I've been a professional operating system developer since 1990 when I was hired to work on Ticketmaster's VAX OS.
