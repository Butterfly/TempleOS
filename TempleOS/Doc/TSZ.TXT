$WW,1$$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Linux TSZ Utility"$$FG$


$FG,2$TSZ [-ascii] filename$FG$

Will uncompress a single file from Linux.  The $FG,2$-ascii$FG$ flag will convert the irregular TempleOS ASCII 5 and ASCII 31 characters to spaces.  (ASCII 5 is used to mark the cursor pos and ASCII 31 is used for shifted space characters and will cause problems unless you convert them.)


$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Windows TSZ Utility"$$FG$

$FG,2$TSZ$FG$ is a Windows cmd line program which will assist transferring files from TempleOS to Windows.  It will also uncompress TempleOS files you have gotten to Windows.  There are three ways to get files from TempleOS to Windows -- via CD-ROM, a $FG,2$FAT32$FG$ partition or via a "file partition" you have created with $FG,2$TSZ$FG$ on a Windows partition.


$FG,2$TSZ -expand [-ascii] dirname$FG$:

will uncompress all TempleOS files with names ending in "$FG,2$.Z$FG$" in a Windows directory and in all subdirectories.  The $FG,2$-ascii$FG$ flag used in combination will convert the irregular TempleOS ASCII 5 and ASCII 31 characters to spaces.  (ASCII 5 is used to mark the cursor pos and ASCII 31 is used for shifted space characters and will cause problems unless you convert them.)  Note: If you pick names not ending in "$FG,2$.Z$FG$", they will not need to be uncompressed.  You can $LK,"Move","MN:Move"$() or $LK,"Copy","MN:Copy"$() them to a name not ending in "$FG,2$.Z$FG$" and they will be stored uncompressed.

allocated by Windows and located by TempleOS, and if you don't mess with them, you can use them to transfer files between TempleOS and Windows.  This is a little risky.  It's pretty safe if you create this file on a partition dedicated for this purpose.

$BK,1$WARNING:$BK,0$ Do not run a defrag operation on a partition holding a file partition.  If you store files to it after such an operation, you'll ruin data on your hard drive.
