* The keyboard can be used as an organ by typing letter keys or clicking the mouse on the keyboard diagram$FG$.  You can "record" notes by pressing the red button and typing letters.  They will appear on the musical staff.  You can edit and save them.

* The clipboard can be used to cut and paste.

* $FG,2$Psalmody$FG$ uses $LK,"HolyC",A="FI:::/Doc/HolyC.TXT"$ files as the song format!  See $LK,"::/Apps/Psalmody/Examples/prosper.CPP"$.  The $FG,2$Psalmody$FG$ program does not fully parse the songs when loading them back in, so changes made outside $FG,2$Psalmody$FG$ will be lost, like if you add graphics.

* The first line of the $LK,"HolyC",A="FI:::/Doc/HolyC.TXT"$ song files is a comment with a category recognized by $LK,"JukeBox",A="FF:::/Apps/Psalmody/JukeBox.CPP,JukeBox"$().  The categories are $FG,2$"no nothing"$FG$, $FG,2$"has words"$FG$, $FG,2$"has graphics"$FG$, or $FG,2$"special"$FG$.  The third character in the song comment is a digit rating number, shown in $LK,"JukeBox",A="FF:::/Apps/Psalmody/JukeBox.CPP,JukeBox"$().  You can set the song rating in $LK,"JukeBox",A="FF:::/Apps/Psalmody/JukeBox.CPP,JukeBox"$() by pressing $FG,2$0$FG$-$FG,2$9$FG$.  You can press $FG,2$<DELETE>$FG$ to delete songs.

* You can take the $LK,"Play",A="MN:Play"$() stmts out of a song file and place them in your programs.  You can also add a song to a document with $FG,2$<CTRL-l>$FG$, but you should do it after pressing $FG,2$<CTRL-t>$FG$ because the clipboard-insert in $FG,2$<CTRL-l>$FG$ is screwy.  See this $SO,"<Song>",A="2qG3ECB2eGG3qCeFDsBGBG2qG3ECB2eGG3qCeFDsBGBGqEeEFqEB2eG3FetCAGqFCEeEFqEB2eG3FetCAGqFC"$ after pressing $FG,2$<CTRL-t>$FG$, now.

* You can call $LK,"JukeBox",A="FF:::/Apps/Psalmody/JukeBox.CPP,JukeBox"$("::/Home/Psalmody"); to play your songs.

* To create a $FG,2$.SND$FG$ file which can be exported and played under Windows, set the $FG,2$Bool$FG$ $LK,"snd.record",A="MN:CSndGlbls"$ to $FG,2$TRUE$FG$, play music, and set it to $FG,2$FALSE$FG$.  Then, call $LK,"SndFileCreate",A="MN:SndFileCreate"$().  You might wish to make a $FG,2$<CTRL-ALT-key>$FG$ to toggle this system level recording feat.  See $LK,"Snd",A="MN:Snd"$().  Add this code to your $LK,"::/Home/HomeKeyPlugIns.CPP"$ file.

$FG,5$U0 CtrlAltR(I64)
{
  snd.record=!snd.record;
}
CtrlAltCBSet('R',&CtrlAltR,"Cmd /Toggle snd.record");$FG$

* When calling $LK,"SndFileCreate",A="MN:SndFileCreate"$() you can set a waveform.  The PC speaker is $LK,"WF_SQUARE",A="MN:WF_SQUARE"$.  You can select reverb and averaging, also.
