$WW,1$* Redo videos, make more professional.

* Nontimer $LK,"Rand",A="MN:Rand"$() is really bad!

* Investigate why packet loss $LK,"Training Sleep(1)",A="FF:::/Adam/Training.CPP,Sleep(1)"$.

* Add AVL binary tree support or red/black whatever that is.  We have fixed-size stack.  Auto-balancing binary tree is very needed.  I've done everything myself.  I don't want to ruin a perfect record.  I'm in no hurry.

* 1/12/16 $LK,"ATARepEntry",A="MN:ATARepEntry"$ shows corrupted buttons.

* 01/06/2016 Editor filter "str" applied to output from LineRep looks broken.

* Get rid of having two terms and pick one, "Disk" and "BlkDev"?  I don't think so.  (Probably not.)

* God said this is bad.  $LK,"FL:::/Adam/DolDoc/DocFind.CPP,41"$

* $LK,"ChkDsk",A="MN:ChkDsk"$ alloc unalloced.

* Should we switch to having just C and D drives (and RAM and CD/DVD)?

* Entering a '$$' in $$TX command's tag

* Should these be moved into $LK,"CHashClass",A="MN:CHashClass"$ from $LK,"CMemberLst",A="MN:CMemberLst"$ and $LK,"CHashGlblVar",A="MN:CHashGlblVar"$?
  CArrayDim dim;
  CHashFun *fun_ptr;

* Might want to warn switch() dup case numbers

* Add cyrillic 8-bit Russian font on aux_font? <CTRL-ALT-f> will toggle fonts.
  Move 12 border chars to screen font codes 0-26?  $LK,"TextBorder",A="MN:TextBorder"$() $LK,"RawDr",A="MN:RawDr"$().
  Add aux_font option with $LK,"chars_bmp_alpha",A="MN:chars_bmp_alpha"$ configured for any aux_font?

* Should we rename chars_bmp_ to set_

* Use standard terminology from "the literature".

* Clean-up ASCII #127 delete char?  (No. Maybe, we want a new usage for 127 in future centuries.)

* $LK,"StrPrintJoin",A="MN:StrPrintJoin"$(,st); With st="\n\\"; (I forgot what this is talking about.)

* 8/2/2015 VMware start-up. Probably multicore.
* $LK,"CtrlAltDel",A="FF:::/Kernel/SerialDev/Keyboard.CPP,CtrlAltDel"$ on <CTRL-ALT-INS>  Probably, VMware bug.

* 1/1/2015 Bug messing-up keyboard, like no CTRL key.  Was working on Sprites.

* 1/?/2015,8/10/2015 Macro select in Menu did not go to shell.  No: I think CTRL-M twice.  (Probably, fixed or not a bug.)

* $LK,"BMPRLE4To",A="MN:BMPRLE4To"$() has files_size too big by 108.  Did I fix it?

* $LK,"FL:::/Adam/Gr/SpriteEd.CPP,789"$ Resize bitmap?

* More $LK,"CCtrl",A="MN:CCtrl"$.

* Add Redo to editor.

* Cannot include ':' in $LK,"Document Links",A="FF:::/Adam/DolDoc/DocLink.CPP,AD"$ search string.

* PSect does not scan all task tables.
* $LK,"R",A="MN:R"$("PSect","Fun-something"); ?
* Maybe let committee decide if we want intern to make binary tree look-up using PSECT symbol addresses, so we can eliminate psect cache and wall-paper kludge.  All HolyC functions and glbl vars would have left-right for address search.


* I think subswitch_start with a break in the preface fails.

* Do $LK,"CTask",A="MN:CTask"$->task_flags need to be in separate cache lines?

* Add DeleteHidden checkbox to <CTRL-F> Filter.

* Add change-triangle-color to mesh editor.
* Add 3D-Mesh Editor make-prism.

* DCF_TRANSFORMATION|DCF_SYMMETRY|DCF_JUST_MIRROR -- maybe not both needed at once.

* DiskCache during FileRead. <CTRL-ALT-C>, $LK,"Kill",A="MN:Kill"$().  

* Get rid of BYTE WORD DWORD in opcode and replace with U8 U16 U32.

* 5/7/14:Something like AFSetIP.CPP caused hang, then reboot in TestSuite.
* 5/7/14:#63 Maybe, $LK,"::/Demo/Graphics/Pick3D.CPP"$ crashed in TestSuite.
* 6/8/14:After or in PageEntries2 in TestSuite crash.

* $$LK,L="FL:D:/Kernel/File.CPP"$$ instead of A=
* $$SP,B=1$$ instead of $$SP,BI=1$$
* $$CM+LE+RE is nasty

* FlatTop is torpedo, not bombs.

* Get rid of text background color.

* Make a game, S.E.T.I., with radio telescope array.  Put God on air. 

* $LK,"Diff",A="MN:Diff"$() flags.

* Backward SHIFT-F3 is broken

* Rename #define to strmap.

* Review writing to same cache-line from multicore.

* MOV U8 [RSP+RCX],DL

* UAsm negative byte displacement, neg 32-bit disp.

* $LK,"Mem32DevAlloc",A="MN:Mem32DevAlloc"$() is broken. Devices should be in free spot of E820 report.

* SPRITES in CMD Line code.

* Might want to move kernel code out of low 2Meg.  Might be faster.

* 4/13/14 Strut or RawHide crashed when sys_var_init_flag etc
was set during testsuite.

* PSect search all tables if not found very well.
* asm LIST NOLIST bug
* Bible ranges. 
* No way to clear +Hold entries

---------------------
$$=-CTASK_NEG_OFFSET
offset(CTask.addr)==0
Spawn(): CAlloc()
TaskFinishOff(): Free()
CSysFixedArea.adam
Looks like task_flags,locked_flags cause problems with neg offset.

COMPILER
  * Postpone LocalVar Init until last possible moment. (in case RETURN)

* DOCF_DBL_DOLLARS in reindention

* HexEdit with odd size, ASCII cannot be edited.

* clean-up addDev pmt

* $LK,"Plain",A="MN:Plain"$() might be better not saving $LK,"CH_CURSOR",A="MN:CH_CURSOR"$.

* TRANSPARENT might not work with line ROPF_DITHER

* It would be nice if $LK,"U",A="MN:U"$() NOP were better.

* unhandled exception on MP message gets overwritten by WinMgr

* Cmd to enable/disable compiler warnings

* What if we had a type for either F64 or I64, like Print -- no conversion.
* What if we had a ... that did do conversion, if we have one that doesn't.

* fix documentation problem -- remembering 0 terminator in str or not for $$DA
* GetS, crazy putkey code
* editor page formatting is FUBAR

* $LK,"gr.screen_image",A="MN:CGrGlbls"$

* GrEdit: Move sidebar selected elems.
	- Be careful of multipt elems.
* GrEdit: Strip origin shift cmds.

* GrEditBitMap, grabscroll? 

* extern of fun with dft arg of str?

* We kinda need a routine to return how much free memory,
so that applications can plan a big alloc.

* FileMgr bad with lots of files.  

* This $LK,"Fs->catch_except=TRUE",A="FF:::/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP,Fs->catch_except=TRUE"$ causes problems because it
catches divide and out-of-mem.  Not sure what to do, yet.

* Make $LK,"Core0StartMP",A="MN:Core0StartMP"$() start work after boot to reset multicores.  Bonus for
freeing old task memory. (Prolly never gonna do anything about this.)

* $LK,"sys_var_init_flag",A="MN:sys_var_init_flag"$ local vars.
* sprite shift pts, ctrl pt for ellipse/polygon w,h is off when rotated.

* Window mgr needs to do DOC operations on posted messages from mouse.
Works for $LK,"IPSet",A="MN:IPSet"$(), though.

* Add local vars to sym table in $LK,"Dbg",A="MN:Dbg"$()?  (maybe)

* $LK,"Bible sized nodes",A="FF:::/Adam/DolDoc/DocRecalc.CPP,->tag+i"$
* Mouseinstall throws exceptions, doesn't work, investigate Mouse $LK,"0x9FC30",A="FF:::/Kernel/SerialDev/Mouse.CPP,9FC"$
* get kbd lights working.
* Might have issue with compiler exceptions and restoring lex.hash tables.
* Generates two compiler error messages for expressions in statements.
* release semaphores or break lock sema,usb_td
* Fix Mom's secondary CD/DVD, dad's primary
* pmtstr in install didn't like focus change

*$FG,2$U0 Main()
{
  U0 (*fp_old_draw_input_ptr)(CDC *dc,I64 x,I64 y)=gr.fp_draw_input_ptr;
}$FG$

* What about local variable array/struct initialization.

* Demo $LK,"ToHtml",A="MN:ToHtml"$().

* Del short name in FAT32--currently I do not check to see if I have generated
a unique short name and one can delete multiple files accidentally.
Generating unique short names is a pain in the ass because you have to scan
the whole directory.  I think I just truncate the name instead of
"Program~1" or whatever.  S081130-0001.BMP crashed windows--two identical
short names.

* OVERSTRIKE at cmd line with menu macro.

* $FG,2$lock{}$FG$ warning on invalid modes.
* Local array vars-->reg.
* $LK,"DCF_SYMMETRY",A="MN:DCF_SYMMETRY"$, before transformation? (Currently it's after)

* Maybe convert graphics to float
* Warn unnecessary typecast
* compiler F32
* compiler optimization heap_glbls with added offset
* Might make FAT32 read in contiguous chunks.
* make Clamp(),Min(),Max() asm routines.
* Might make CSprite flood fill operate on a separate bitmap
and blotted at the end.
* autofile popup of popup
* <CTRL-r> delete subsprite in menu near others
* consider changing domenu so a real <ESC> on menu item doesn't select
(<SPACE> sends <ESC> followed by <SPACE> or something)
* puts3 with depth buf?  might not do this
* make task queins and querem safe for multicore cycling through tasks (fwd).
* make better heapwalk, do something with _CFG_HEAP_DBG.
* log to file--would be inefficient--load-in whole file, modify and write out.
Useful, but not very efficient  (TempleOS file system has no grow-file ability.
Created when FAT patent was an issue and wanted absly nothing people could sue
me for.)
* APIC2
* import intel datasheets, somehow?
* Get better dictionary, good spell checker.
* AutoComplete/Man Jmp for user code.
* Might make DskView show drive colors.
* Might do utility to set drive colors, making a tree entry in Adam 3 using
registry-like routines... or registry I guess.

* New Editor widgets

* Make use of flag potential in $LK,"FilesFind",A="MN:FilesFind"$() and possibly $LK,"DirContextNew",A="MN:DirContextNew"$()
* implement fixed pos files

* new HolyC language features
* better debugging

* Look for mem leaks.
* Move stuff out of Kernel module.

* $LK,"ROP_XOR",A="MN:ROP_XOR"$ with pen_width>1 is broken.
* BGR wrong in BMP files.

* use width and height in line clipping for pen_width>1 or blot.
* SIMD transformation
* test removable media id  (critical for resident files)

* add field overflow U8 "t='*'"
* Implement fmt codes into Get
* Date Input
* Default date fmt

* 16 bit Unassembly is bad--very low priority
* more signed int disassembly
* support r4u8 by adding 0x40 byte
* static var off of data heap.
* Might want to use U32*U32 multiplication.
* could add "const" to not set CCF_NOT_CONST flag for trig, etc.
* do r,rm ICCmp like ICBrCmp
* could make glblvar imports use TY_RIP_DISP32.
* PUSH_CMP allocs reg R9 or whatever
* Might be problem with NOP in OPT pass1 for NO_PUSH in expressions besides
assignments.  Is ShiftNoPush fully implemented?
* NOP1 might need to have diff ic_data's
* in divequal, it assumes about ebx
* error/warning line nums
* ASM branch out warning of range off by 1 line--use cc->last_line_num

* $LK,"Who",A="MN:Who"$("-r"); Capital r is strongly desired.

* Switch statement with sparse cases (low priority)
* maybe inline functions?
* Use of more floating-point stk?

* More aggressive in this routine $LK,"CmpF2PushPop",A="MN:CmpF2PushPop"$() with types besides MOV and F64. 
* !dbl ~dbl
* &=, |= can overflow with Bts Btr on small data types

* num lock comes on with break key
* sort options for findfiles
* Maybe, get rid of $LK,"0x20000",A="FF:::/Compiler/CMain.CPP,0x20000"$ in compiler.
