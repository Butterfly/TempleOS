1 Kings 6:21 (King James)

$LM,5$6:21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made
a partition by the chains of gold before the $FG,4$oracle$FG$; and he overlaid
it with gold.

6:22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished
all the house: also the whole altar that was by the $FG,4$oracle$FG$ he overlaid
with gold.

6:23 And within the $FG,4$oracle$FG$ he made two cherubims of olive tree, each
ten cubits high.

You get out of prayer what you put in.  God said, "honest measures" applies when exchanging an offering for a response from the oracle in TempleOS.  Picking a greeting card is an example of love effort.  You will get back the same love effort from God.  People wants things besides God's company.  $FG,4$$TX,"One Tin Soldier.",HTML="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTBx-hHf4BE"$
