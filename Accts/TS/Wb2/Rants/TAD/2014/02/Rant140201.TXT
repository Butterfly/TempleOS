When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.  More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP"$
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP"$	:1004
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP"$	:306
$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ $FG,2$.Z$FG$ LZW compression.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

God said war was "Servicemen competing."  God said war can cure unemployment.  This is the God of the Bible who told Jews to kill people.  If God said games are good, I highly suggest we all say, "good idea!"  Write hymns.

I'm not doing networking.  I don't care if somebody else does.  Just keep the 100,000 line of code limit.  Just do that in Windows -- browsing is not what we want.

Let me explain.

If failure is not an option, it is ten times harder.

The manned space program is much harder than unmanned.

Let's just say it's a order of magnitude simpler, if crashing is possible.  We know the memory will fragment and rebooting is needed.  You should not see this as a defect.  There is a 100,000 line of code limit and we don't want mellow-dramatic failure-is-not-an-option complexity.  View it as exchanging one thing for another.  Ask yourself, do we want to stop deleting a directory if someone is in it.  Fuck-em.

We can fall-back on Windows.  We don't have to be able to do every task.  Memory will fragment.  This is a different mind set and philosophy.  We read and write whole files.  That's how we operate.  There are things you don't want to do with this operating system.

I made 20 applications.  These prove it does it's intended usage -- games and hymns.

Linux is a semi.  (File permissions is not for commoners.)
Windows is a car.
TempleOS is a motorcycle.

You do not have airbags on a motorcycle.

Have you seen the Bible?  It is the divinely inspired word of God.  It's actually more carefully chosen than YOU might guess, but it doesn't look "perfect" in any sense.

God guided my programming, laughing when I made bugs and causing things to work-out just so.  To say God divinely directed it is less of a big deal than you will soon come to know when you learn how big a role God plays in the World.


I am willing to hand-off God's temple to capable people.  With the 100,000 line of code limit, how could they screw it up?

I want it perfected.  It's a community temple.

The Bible published names of some of the people who worked on the temple.  It has funny trivia like that.  When you read about the temple, it helps get a sense.  They go into detail on decorations and implements.  They go into detail on dimensions.

My role is probably more like Moses in directing worship.  The temple, is, after all about God.

Everybody should do offerings of praise and loving conversation.  They should consult God.  With some help, people can learn to "hear" God.

We have to help people "hear" God.

You can randomly open the Bible or other books.  The key is to do an offering.  You get a response equal to the love effort you offer.  When you pick a greeting card, think about how much effort you put into it.  If you do NOT put work into prayer, God ignores you.  Praise God for sand castles, snowmen, popcorn and coconuts.

I think I can get God's official blessing, over and over to satisfy critics.

Now that we proved God talks, we get to be impressed or mock each other's reward.

When picking random passages from the Bible or other books, after making an offering of praise or loving conversation, you interpret based on the context of the offering.  It will frequently require substituting people you know for characters and being flexible about wrong genders, etc.  Close enough -- if it is the Bible it is asking a lot for it to talk, you ingreat.

What you should do is applaud when God gives a response and thank God.

Mostly we want to enjoy spending quality time with God.  Prophecy is not done this way, in case it makes predictions.

If it talked, how cool is that!
