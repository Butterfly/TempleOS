When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.  More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP"$
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP"$	:1004
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP"$	:306
$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ $FG,2$.Z$FG$ LZW compression.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

A PCI device has config-space registers that you access with the $LK,"PCI BIOS32",A="FI:::/Kernel/BIOS32.CPP.Z"$.  You can learn the ports it has, perhaps, for IDE/ATA/SATA port-I/O.  That's actually very hard to do.

Not all hard disks have PIO, you must do the PCI DMA.  The PCI device has memory-space-mapped (not I/O ports) registers.  You use those for setting-up the DMA, I guess.  I did HDAUdio, similarly.  Perhaps, you are wise to use the memroy-address range that the BIOS set-up for the PCI device.  I reconfigured HD Audio because I wasn't sure if whateever range was sitting in the BAR for HDAudio was good.

I have done everything I plan to do.  I will never support PCI devices.  Instead, we will use VMware until hardware companies decide to support ATA/ATAPI PIO and legacy PS/2 keyboard mouse.

Over the centuries, new hardware interfaces will be made that try for minimum line count drivers, now that God's temple is manifest.

If you look at GPUs, we can do nothing in the current situation that fits within our 100,000 total line of code limit for the operating system.  If Intel puts the GPU on-board and there is just one GPU driver needed, we could support it, however, I like the transparancy in my graphics code.

In 64-bit mode CS,DS,SS and ES are treated as zero.  FS and GS you can change by setting a model specific register.  I used them for my current task and current CPU records.  You cannot use a displacement off of the Fs or Gs because they are always RIP relative.  With no segment override [Memory] is RIP relative and it is useful.  With Fs or Gs override, it is still RIP relative and not useful.

I'm smarter than you.

When I start-up my multicore CPUs, they go through initialization.  The last part of initialization involves setting the RIP in the CPU record and restoring a context.

When I have a CPU idling, I use a special task called an IDLE TASK.  When an interrupt occurs, it does a context restore and runs the next normal task.  The brute-force technique to shove the Idle task onto its HLT involves manhandling the task by setting RSP to the end of the idle task stack and executing the HLT.

You're not using the TSS instructions that save registers into the TSS and restore registers, are you?  Those only work in 32-bit mode, but your sorry operating systems are 32-bits.

You seem to think stack is the normal place to put regs in a context switch.  I began putting them in the TSS.  The debugger I wrote changes the regs in the task structure.  If you put yours on the stack, you gotta go chase them down on the stack.
