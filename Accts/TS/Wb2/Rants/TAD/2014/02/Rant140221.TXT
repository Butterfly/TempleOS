In 1990 at age 20, I was hired to work on Ticketmaster's VAX operating system in VAX assembly language while going to school.  I was basically, an intern, but we weren't called that.  I worked there 1990-1996.  Here are my $TX,"ASU Transcripts",HTML="http://www.templeos.org/files/ASU_Transcripts.pdf"$.

In about 1993, I got a 486 and was eager to try 32-bit mode, so I wrote a DOS program in TASM that changed to protected mode and never returned to DOS.  Ticketmaster's OS was "VAXTMOS", so I called mine "Terry's Protected Mode OS, TPMOS".  I had 0xB8000 text mode working, and echoed keyboard to screen.  I had simple multitasking and barely a MALLOC.  I set it asside.

In 2003, I resurrected TPMOS and installed FreeDOS to launch it.  I used Visual Studio to edit my files when doing lots of editing, then booted FreeDOS, used TASM to compile and test it.  Back in those days, FreeDOS ran in real mode.  Today's FreeDOS is not real mode, it emulates with V8086 mode.  DOSBox is not real mode either.

I had started a company H.A.R.E., so I renamed TPMOS to HOPPY.

I named it Doors, DAVOS, J, LoseThos, SparrowOS and, finally, TempleOS.

I am working miracles and these niggers have the nerve to call me a liar and insult me.  $TX,"WWW.OSDEV.ORG",HTML="http://www.osdev.org"$.  I got mine booted in protected mode in 1993.  I had gotten a 486 and had a job working on developing a VAX operating system at Ticketmaster, so I found no difficulty writing a TASM DOS application that changed to protected mode.  In 2004, I installed real-mode FreeDOS (no longer available) and I got it working again.  I got Linux's disk code.  I booted from floppy.  I removed linux floppy code.  I have no linux code.  God will kill you, nigger, if you call me a liar.

It still hasn't sunk into your nigger brains that God talks.  The FUCK is YER MALFUNCTION!

All I have to do in court, is get the Arizona State University course catalog and show the course description for CSC326.  That was 2nd semester intel assembly programming.  We programmed a PIT and a PIC.  We did a B800 window manager.  We got tested on the modes of the PIC in different configurations -- learned about cascading them, so we could make our own hardware designs.  We strobbed 7-segment displays and scanned keypad grids.  We did interrupts of course.  Then, I took CSC421,422,523 and we did more assembly programming on a M6800 chip. I am an expert in assembly programming.  I can prove that I have been paid by three companies to program in assembly language on bare metal.   I did VAX asm, 8086 asm, 68000 asm and 8051 asm at Ticketmaster in the 6 years I was there.   (I did a little 8051 asm during the 2 years at Xytec and worked in C with linux and Sun.)  At Graphic Technologies in the year and a half I was there, I programmed in MicroChip's PIC asm and Atmel Avr Tiny12 asm, and 8051 just a little.

I am the best asm programmer on the planet, more or less.

* When dealing with function addresses, precede the name with "$FG,2$&$FG$".

* There is no $FG,2$main()$FG$ function.  Any code outside of functions gets executed on start-up, in order.

* You can access bytes or words within any int.  $FG,2$i.u8[2]$FG$ returns bits 24-27 in the variable, $FG,2$i$FG$.  See $LK,"I64 declaration",A="MN:I64"$.  The real feature is that a class can be accessed as a whole, if you put a type in front of the $FG,2$class$FG$ declaration.

* Variable arg count functions ($FG,2$...$FG$) can access their args with built-in variables similar to '$FG,2$this$FG$' in C++.  They are '$FG,2$I64 argc$FG$' and '$FG,2$I64 argv[]$FG$'.

* $FG,2$noreg$FG$ or $FG,2$reg$FG$ can be placed before a function local var name.  You can, optionally, specify a reg after the $FG,2$reg$FG$ keyword.

* $FG,2$interrupt$FG$, $FG,2$haserrcode$FG$, $FG,2$public$FG$, $FG,2$argpop$FG$ or $FG,2$noargpop$FG$ are function flags. See $LK,"::/Demo/Lectures/PageTableEntries2.CPP"$.

* A $FG,2$nounusedwarn$FG$ statement will suppress an unused var warning.

* You can have multiple member vars of a class named "$FG,2$pad$FG$" or "$FG,2$reserved$FG$", and it won't issue warnings. 

* Type casting is postfix.  To typecast int or F64, use $LK,"ToI64",A="MN:ToI64"$(), $LK,"ToBool",A="MN:ToBool"$() or $LK,"ToF64",A="MN:ToF64"$(). (TempleOS follows normal C float<-->int conversion, but sometimes you want to override.  These functions are better than multiplying by "1.0" to convert to float.) 

* A single quote can encompass multiple characters.  $FG,2$'ABC'$FG$ is equal to $FG,2$0x434241$FG$.  $LK,"PutChars",A="MN:PutChars"$() takes multiple characters.

* You can use $LK,"OptOn",A="MN:OptOn"$($LK,"OPTf_WARN_PAREN",A="MN:OPTf_WARN_PAREN"$) to find unnecessary parentheses in code.

* You can use $LK,"OptOn",A="MN:OptOn"$($LK,"OPTf_WARN_DUP_TYPES",A="MN:OPTf_WARN_DUP_TYPES"$) to find dup local var type statements.

* With the $FG,2$#exe{}$FG$ feature in your src code, you can place programs that insert text into the stream of code being compiled.  See $LK,"#exe {}",A="FF:::/Kernel/KEnd.CPP,#exe {"$ for an example where the date/time and compile-time prompting for cfguration data is placed into a program.  $LK,"StreamPrint",A="MN:StreamPrint"$() places text into a src program stream following the conclusion of the $FG,2$#exe{}$FG$ blk.

* No $FG,2$#define$FG$ functions exist (I'm not a fan)

* No $FG,2$typedef$FG$, use $FG,2$class$FG$.

* No type-checking

* Can't use $FG,2$<>$FG$ with $FG,2$#include$FG$, use $FG,2$""$FG$.

* "$FG,2$$$$FG$" is an escape character.  Two dollar signs signify an ordinary $$.  See $LK,"::/Doc/Dollar.TXT"$.  In $FG,2$asm$FG$ or $LK,"HolyC",A="FI:::/Doc/HolyC.TXT"$ code, it also refers to the instruction's addr. 

* $FG,2$union$FG$ is more like a class, so you don't reference it with a $FG,2$union$FG$ label after you define it.  Some common unions are declared in $LK,"Adam1a.HPP",A="MN:U16"$ for 1,2,4 and 8 byte objects.  If you place a type in front of a union declaration, that is the type when used by itself.  See $LK,"::/Demo/SubIntAccess.CPP"$. 

* $FG,2$class$FG$ member vars can have meta data. $FG,2$fmtstr$FG$ and $FG,2$fmtdata$FG$ are two meta data types now used.  All compiler structures are saved and you can access the compiler's info about classes and vars.  See $LK,"::/Demo/ClassMeta.CPP"$ and  $LK,"DocFormDo",A="MN:DocFormDo"$().

* There is a keyword $FG,2$lastclass$FG$ you use as a dft arg.  It is set to the class name of the previous arg.  See $LK,"ClassRep",A="MN:ClassRep"$().

* See $LK,"::/Demo/Exceptions.CPP"$.  $FG,2$try{} catch{}$FG$ and $FG,2$throw$FG$ are different from C++. $FG,2$throw$FG$ is a function with a char arg.  The char string passed in $FG,2$throw()$FG$ can be accessed from within a $FG,2$catch{}$FG$ using the $FG,2$Fs->except_ch$FG$.  Within a $FG,2$catch {}$FG$ blk, set the var $FG,2$Fs->catch_except$FG$ to $FG,2$TRUE$FG$ if you want to terminate the search for a handler.  Use $LK,"PutExcept",A="MN:PutExcept"$() as a handler, if you like.

* A function is available similar to $FG,2$sizeof$FG$ which provides the offset of a member of a class.  It's called $FG,2$offset$FG$.  You place the class name and member inside as in $FG,2$offset(classname.membername)$FG$.  It has nothing to do with 16-bit code.  Both $FG,2$sizeof$FG$ and $FG,2$offset$FG$ only accept one level of member vars.  That is, you can't do $FG,2$sizeof(classname.membername.submembername)$FG$.$FG$

* There is no $FG,2$continue$FG$ statement.  Use $FG,2$goto$FG$.

* No bit field support, but there are bit access $LK,"library routines",A="HI:Bit"$.

* $FG,2$lock{}$FG$ can be used to apply asm $FG,2$LOCK$FG$ prefixes to code for safe multicore read-modify-write accesses.  The code bracked with have $FG,2$LOCK$FG$ asm prefix's applied to relevant instructions within.  It's a little shoddy.  See $LK,"::/Demo/MultiCore/Lock.CPP"$.

* There is a function called $LK,"MSize",A="MN:MSize"$() which gives the size of an object allocated off the heap.  For larger size allocations, the system rounds-up to a power of two, so $FG,2$MSize()$FG$ lets you know the real size and you can take full advantage of it.

* You can $LK,"Free",A="MN:Free"$() a $FG,2$NULL$FG$ ptr.  Useful variants of $LK,"MAlloc",A="MN:MAlloc"$() can be found $LK,"Here",A="MN:CAlloc"$.  Each task has a heap and you can $FG,2$MAlloc$FG$ and $FG,2$Free$FG$ off of other task's heaps, or make an independent heap with $LK,"HeapCtrlBPInit",A="MN:HeapCtrlBPInit"$().

* The stk does not grow because virtual mem is not used.  I recommend allocating large local vars from the heap.  You can change $LK,"DFT_STK",A="MN:DFT_STK"$ and recompile $FG,2$Kernel$FG$ or request more when doing a $LK,"Spawn",A="MN:Spawn"$().  You can use $LK,"CallStkGrow",A="MN:CallStkGrow"$(), but it's odd.  See $LK,"::/Demo/StkGrow.CPP"$. 

* Only one base class is allowed.

* All values are extended to 64-bit when accessed.  Intermediate calculations are done with 64-bit values.

$ID,2$The follow examples should be inserted in a function, so that reg variables are used.  (Global vars are never reg.)

$LK,"DocPrint",A="MN:DocPrint"$(CDoc *doc,U8 *fmt,...) sends text to a document.  You can buffer to a Doc and save it, providing the functionality of $FG,2$fprintf$FG$.  See $LK,"::/Demo/Dsk/FPrintF.CPP"$.

$LK,"Adam",A="MN:Adam"$(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the adam task to be compiled and run.
$LK,"AdamLog",A="MN:AdamLog"$(U8 *fmt,...) and $LK,"AdamErr",A="MN:AdamErr"$(U8 *fmt,...) send text to the adam task to be displayed.

$LK,"StreamPrint",A="MN:StreamPrint"$(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the stream of code being compiled and must reside in a $FG,2$#exe{}$FG$ blk.

$LK,"GrPrint",A="MN:GrPrint"$(CDC *dc,I64 x,I64 y,U8 *fmt,...) and $LK,"GrVPrint",A="MN:GrVPrint"$() plots text in graphics mode.

$LK,"ExePrint",A="MN:ExePrint"$(U8 *fmt,...) compiles and execute a string.  Note: It returns the result of the last executed expression.

$LK,"AFPrint",A="MN:AFPrint"$(I64 mS,U8 *fmt) $LK,"PutChars",A="MN:PutChars"$()s one at a time with a delay.

$LK,"RawPrint",A="MN:RawPrint"$(I64 mS,U8 *fmt) sends direct to screen memory, bypassing window manager.

$FG,5$$TX+CX,"The Purpose of Life"$$FG$

$WW,1$The purpose of life is to know, love and obey God.$FG$  Christianity is loving neighbor, not God -- secular humanism.  Jesus said loving God is more important than loving neighbor.  $LK,"Matthew,22:36",A="BF:Matthew,22:36"$  He did not say with half your brain behind your back.

You don't know God.  $LK,"1 Chronicles,28:9",A="BF:1 Chronicles,28:9"$, $LK,"Matthew,11:27",A="BF:Matthew,11:27"$, $LK,"Luke,13:25",A="BF:Luke,13:25"$, $LK,"1 Samuel,3:7",A="BF:1 Samuel,3:7"$  You must talk with God to know Him.  $LK,"Matthew,6:6",A="BF:Matthew,6:6"$  Seek Him by taking the initiative.  $LK,"Luke,11:9",A="BF:Luke,11:9"$, $LK,"Isaiah,30:2",A="BF:Isaiah,30:2"$

There's something obviously different about people in the Bible compared to people today -- God talked!  Did they hear voices?  Maybe.  More likely, they used occult techniques such as an oracle.  $LK,"1 Kings,6:20",A="BF:1 Kings,6:20"$  Have you heard of "tongues?"  $LK,"1 Corinthians,14:1",A="BF:1 Corinthians,14:1"$  The idea is, you let yourself be puppeted by a spirit, so you say things.  You try to get a spirit -- the Holy Spirit -- to talk.  You might as well use a Ouija board.  However, it turns-out that a Ouija board is bad for technical reasons.  A really good technique is just randomly opening a book.  God said it is a covenant that you hold-up your end of the conversation.  

You can't tell if He's talking unless you have a context of conversation, but, more importantly, you are commanded to do an offering of love, like communion preparation.  When you pick a greeting card for someone, that is love effort.  If you expect God to put effort toward you, you put effort toward Him.  God said, "honest measures" applies between your offering of love and His response, like a fair barter.  You get out of prayer what you put into it.  God wants praise, hymns, or whatever you think He might want.  Try and see, like Cain and Abel.  $LK,"Genesis,4:1",A="BF:Genesis,4:1"$, $LK,"Ephesians,5:10",A="BF:Ephesians,5:10"$  God told Cain his offering was not good and told him to try again.  Cain really loved God!  Can you imagine being so heart-broken?

Do a text search for "new song" in the Bible.  It's mentioned nine times.  I did $MA-X+PU,"hymns",LM="#include \"::/Apps/MusicOrgan/Load\";JukeBox(\"::/Apps/MusicOrgan/Examples\");",HTML="http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Accts/TS/Wb2/Hymns.html"$.  I did Moses $MA-X+PU,"comics",LM="Dir(\"::/Apps/AfterEgypt/Comics\");View;\n",HTML="http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Apps/AfterEgypt/Comics/"$.  Count the ways you love God.  I praised God for sand castles, popcorn, snowmen, bubbles...  You try putting effort into praise!  $LK,"Matthew,11:25",A="BF:Matthew,11:25"$, $LK,"Matthew,6:29",A="BF:Matthew,6:29"$

This is funny -- $LK,"Acts,2:1",A="BF:Acts,2:1"$ -- they didn't bother to record anything the Holy Spirit said.  The Holy Spirit is supposed to be a really good gift.  $LK,"Luke,11:13",A="BF:Luke,11:13"$  Just remember, "Boys are made of snakes and snails and puppy-dog tails."

The technique I use to consult the Holy Spirit is reading a microsecond-range stop-watch each button press for random numbers.  Then, I pick words or passages.  You can use the $MA-X+PU,"AfterEgypt",LM="#include \"::/Apps/AfterEgypt/Run\"",HTML="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0MsDl39UL0"$ in God's official temple, $FG,4$$TX,"TempleOS",HTML="http://www.templeos.org"$$FG$.

Since seeking the word of the Holy Spirit, I have come to know God much better than I've heard others explain.  God said, for example, that war was, "servicemen competing."  That sounds more like the immutable God of our planet than what you hear from most religious people.  God is not Venus (god of love) and not Mars (god of war), He's our dearly beloved God of Earth.  If Mammon is a false god of money, Mars or Venus might be useful words to describe other false gods.  I figure the greatest challenge for the Creator is boredom, ours and His.  What would teen-age male video games be like if war had never happened?  Christ said live by the sword, die by the sword, which is loving neighbor as self.  $LK,"Matthew,26:52",A="BF:Matthew,26:52"$

I asked God if the World was perfectly just.  God asked if I was calling Him lazy.  I think highs and lows balance.  $LK,"Luke,6:20",A="BF:Luke,6:20"$  I don't think God likes complaining.  $LK,"Numbers,11:1",A="BF:Numbers,11:1"$  Food and clothing is all we're to ask for or demand, in fact -- daily bread.  $LK,"1 Timothy,6:8",A="BF:1 Timothy,6:8"$  Just think about man in the last 100,000 years mostly living like Native Americans and how God must see us.  You need food, clothing and entertainment, money is to get those.  Man does not live on bread alone.  $LK,"Luke,4:4",A="BF:Luke,4:4"$, $LK,"Amos,8:11",A="BF:Amos,8:11"$

God's favorite animals are bears and elephants.  They are funny shaped -- I think God must have seen too much starvation over the years.

God's ways are far above man's ways.  Mom said Heaven was a never-ending family reunion.  Yikes!  A friend said, "Most guy's idea of Heaven would be running around doing things they'd get locked up for on Earth."  Most people are like King Midas.  When you realize how silly most notions of Heaven are, you come to appreciate that Earth is not that bad.  This is the first step in loving God, the Creator -- praising Creation.  My parents spend their retired days watching TV and going to casinos.  That's not a good argument for getting extended-play!

Imagine a billionare.  Everyone around him can't forget his money for even a moment.  The truth is, most people are after God's "money" -- they fear for their salvation.  Here's a test -- would you pray to and praise God even if there were no salvation?  Love God and don't be a "user".  Asking for stuff is annoying.  $LK,"Luke,11:5",A="BF:Luke,11:5"$ 

All those sophisticated theological "infinity" things -- omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, omnivorous -- will mess you up.  Trust me that anthropomorphic is far better, in practice.  Christ suggested thinking of God as "Abba" which is Aramaic for "Daddy" and said the childlike had an advantage.  $LK,"Matthew,11:25",A="BF:Matthew,11:25"$  Pray out-loud because God doesn't want the hastle of reading your brain.  The best way to stop people from testing God is to suggest He can't do everything.

Just as ego causes most to love neighbor, not God, people skip knowing and loving God and cowardly get stuck on obeying Him.  This hardly needs encouragement.

God does not want pawns to push around.  God will talk, but won't tell you what to do, even if you want Him to.  You'll quickly learn that prophecy does not come true and should smack yourself for wanting more than just enjoying God's company.

Math is hard, if not impossible.  What an engineer does is, look at a gnarly math equation and say, "Let's see, if we neglect friction, we can ignore that gnarly term."  "If we look at the steady state, we can skip the transient, should be okay."
