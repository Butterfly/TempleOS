Is that guy a saint, God?

God just said, "If you have food, be content."

By my logic a zoo is where you should put money.  It results in the most praise of God.

I mostly praise God for animals.  I watch cooking shows and praise God for food, LOL.

I like telescopes.

No!  This guy is a saint.

water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he
gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river,
because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.

14:16 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who
did sin, and who made Israel to sin.

14:17 And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and
when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died; 14:18 And
they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word
of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the
prophet.

reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel.

9:6 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a
man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came
before Moses and before Aaron on that day: 9:7 And those men said unto
him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept
back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed
season among the children of Israel?  9:8 And Moses said unto them,
Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning
you.

9:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 9:10 Speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity
shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar
off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.

9:11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep

Food is a funny thing.  The frozen dinner I ate, I used to really enjoy.  You get sick of stuff.  That's why I don't think we have to worry about the poor very much.

I was just thinking of dill seeds.  You know what's good?  Cheese with dill.

Did anybody ever give You a sandwich, God?

captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice
with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a
