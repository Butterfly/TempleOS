I have my own BIN format.  God's temple must be perfect.  We don't support crufty ELF, never will.  Everything must be fresh and perfect and 64-bit.

The only thing more perfect than supporting 3 file systems is supporting one.  I am ordering Microsoft and Linux to support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z"$ file system.

Low line count is the main priority when making decisions.

All code must be placed in the lowest 2 Gig of addresses.  This is called the "code heap".  Yer fucken retard-niggers.

My compiler makes a map file with source line information.  When you boot, it loads Compiler.MAP and Kernel.MAP.  I made them use 32-bit code heap addresses.
