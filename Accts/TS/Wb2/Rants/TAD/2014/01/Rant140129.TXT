I'm laughing.  John Carmack was giving me shit for being lazy.  There's something just like Dante's Inferno  (People in the story get put in different parts of Hell based on their sins.)  People want to make video games.  They get a little bit older and it's probably not any fun.  I don't know why I'm mean.  I was just thinking, "Boy that Boulderdash game really did not look like fun.  Now, that I think about it, what is fun?"

That Eve spaceship game seemed really really stupid.  I know I could make something more fun.  God those people have no imagination, just sorry-ass stupid people ripping-off Star Wars and Star Trek.  I'll bet they don't do spacewalks and their physics suck.  Yeah, their lasers were not invisible.

Not that it matters, but putting $FG,2$asm{}$FG$ around your asm code makes it compile faster.  It has to kick into and out of ASM mode when you mix C and asm without $FG,2$asm{}$FG$.  Each label causes it to kick into-and-out of asm mode.  What it does is... when it parses a statement, if it is an ASM opcode, it jump into asm mode and stays in asm mode as long as it sees opcodes.  A label is not an opcode and causes it to kick out of asm mode to C mode, then back to asm mode for the opcode.

Nevermind -- it's ridiculously fast, even when it's slow.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.  More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP"$
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP"$	:1004
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP"$	:306
$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ $FG,2$.Z$FG$ LZW compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  $LK,"DCSave",A="MN:DCSave"$(), $LK,"GRAWrite",A="MN:GRAWrite"$(), $LK,"DCLoad",A="MN:DCLoad"$(), and $LK,"GRARead",A="MN:GRARead"$().  $LK,"::/Kernel/Compress.CPP"$




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

Let's do a miracle.

Walruses?  They're funny.  A policeman with a mustache might look like a walrus.  They're not very famous.  Beatles praise You for octopuses AND walruses.  I'm going to do an elephant song.  And an elephant video game.  You rampage Indians who are evil and destroy their temples and steal their gold and give it to God.  The Jews stole gold from other gods and made cheribim for God.  God thought that was nice.

$FG,4$the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust
made fat with fatness.

34:8 For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of
recompences for the controversy of Zion.

34:9 And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust
thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning
pitch.

34:10 It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall
go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none
shall pass through it for ever and ever.

34:11 But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also
and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the
line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.

34:12 They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none
shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.$FG$

I wuv God.  God wuvs me.  It's okay.  Wuv is Wuv.  Release your feelings and really wuv God, for reals.
