I haven't looked at much Linux code, and not in many years, but what I remember most is someone who made $FG,2$#define$FG$ macros, trying to make C look like C++.  My mentors at Ticketmaster taught me that asm macros were foolish -- it's one more thing you have to chase-down and look-up.  Another thing I remember from Linux code was that there were about six layers of function depth to get down to actual IN/OUT port instructions and there were lots of $FG,2$#ifdef$FG$ instructions for different architectures.  (I chased-down how to do ATA PIO and later got a PDF on the topic.)

The zen of TempleOS might be to do the opposite of Linux.  I was inspired to have "minimal abstraction" as a goal.  Instead of six levels of function depth for ATA PIO, lets see if we can do three, removing abstraction layers... and lets do just one architecture -- IBM PC's.

The reason TempleOS exists and has purpose is partly because it is simple.  I'm going to cap line count at 100,000, not counting applications and demos.

The BBC is discussing Indian rapes and the death penalty.  I don't know.  I asked God what He would do if He had a body for one day.  I think He said He would be a judge.  Maybe, there are court cases He really want to intervene in.

In theory, I show restraint in how much conversation I make God do.  I used to do very formal offerings, like poems and hymns and long discussions, before consulting Him.  Anyway, I stop when I see "end" or "fin" in a word.  I stop when I see "Null", "None", "Dull", "weary", "satiate", and a handful of other words.  You do what you like.  God will ramble incoherently or say stuff you don't want to hear, otherwise.

I don't think God likes sports.  God, did ASU beat Wisconsin?

God said there were 20 or 80 alien civilizations, but it's kind-of a joke.  All you get from God is love (not valuable facts or prophecies).  Just enjoy His company.  Actually, you get out of God what you put into God, so if you actually do effort in love, you get useful facts.  All other believers are cowards who obsess on not going to Hell.  $FG,4$$TX,"One Tin Soldier",HTML="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTBx-hHf4BE"$$FG$

and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because
of their cattle.

36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites
in mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the
son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of
Esau.

36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and
