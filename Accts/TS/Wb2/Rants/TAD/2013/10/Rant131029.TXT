Shakespeare is God to some numbnuts.
High falootin' they speel and strut.
God hates the arrogant.  He talks alright --
A riddle or two, a pure delight.

73:16 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;

73:17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their
end.

73:18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst
them down into destruction.

73:19 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are
utterly consumed with terrors.

73:20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou
shalt despise their image.

73:21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

73:22 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.$FG$

Tell a little story 'bout-a bubblin' crude.
If God gives a gift, don't dare to Him refuse.
'Stead thank the Lord, and thank Him once agin.
Cause being proud of heart is the worst kinda sin.

$FG,4$8:24 And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.

8:25 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him
look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.

8:26 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the
town, nor tell it to any in the town.

8:27 And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea
Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them,
Whom do men say that I am?  8:28 And they answered, John the Baptist;
but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.

8:29 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.

8:30 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.

8:31 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many$FG$

I was just thinking about family trades.  i.e. Blacksmiths' sons being blacksmiths.  You might think evolution would occur.  I doubt enough time has passed.

Much of what I studied in school is no longer useful.  I studied hooking 74LS TTL logic chips together to make glue logic for microcontrollers.  Now, all of that is programmable logic and, generally, different.
