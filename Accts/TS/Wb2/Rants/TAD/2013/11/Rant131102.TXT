Maybe, He can say what He likes about cats.  They lick themselves and purr.

I saw a story on bloatware.

My 100,000 lines of code limit is because of human brain limits.  I want this to be cozy for users who look at the code and write programs.

You might be surprised that 256Meg is not enough and it needs 512Meg of RAM.  That's because memory fragments with no paging (identity-mapping) and because I load whole files.  If you generate a new distribution ISO, you will generate a new size chunk for each different size of file and 256 Meg will not be enough.

I'm not an old-timer who hates kids that waste capacity.

answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king,

And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the
