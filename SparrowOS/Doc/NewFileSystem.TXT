If you want to add a support for a new file system, do a text search on "PT_FAT32".  All the places where that occurs will require new entries for your file system type.  $MA+A-X+PU,"Click here for search.","Grep(\"PT_FAT32\",\"/SparrowOS/\" SRC_FILE_MASK);View;"$

You will also need to add an entry $LK,"here.","FF:::/SparrowOS/OSMain/Define1a.CPP.Z,ST_PRT_TYPES"$
