$WW,1$A $FG,4$CSprite$FG$, is an ordered list of the $LK,"following","MN:GRST_END"$ elements, created with $FG,2$<CTRL-R>$FG$$FG$.  Normally, they are packed together in a list and the addr of the first is passed to routines.

See $LK,"::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot.CPP.Z","FI:::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot.CPP.Z"$, $LK,"::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot3D.CPP.Z","FI:::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot3D.CPP.Z"$ and $LK,"::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SpritePut.CPP.Z","FI:::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SpritePut.CPP.Z"$ and $LK,"CSpriteMesh","MN:CSpriteMesh"$().

Be aware that copying $FG,2$SP$FG$, $FG,2$IB$FG$, or $FG,2$IS$FG$ entries with the clipboard results in duplicate entries with different nums.  You can manually remove dups by editing with $FG,2$<CTRL-T>$FG$ and setting to the original num.

See $LK,"::/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrSpritePlot.CPP.Z","FL:::/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrSpritePlot.CPP.Z,1"$ for how CSprite are stored.$FG$
