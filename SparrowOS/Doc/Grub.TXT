$FG,5$$TX+CX,"The Grub Master Bootloader"$$FG$

$WW,1$Here are my $FG,2$grub.cfg$FG$ file entries for my SparrowOS partitions.  I don't have the patience to do it correctly and GRUB obfuscates.  Chain loading is just the normal way an operating system like Windows boots.  They do drives, zero-based, and partitions on drives, one-based.  They call traditional partitioning a "msdos" partition and I presume, if there is a new way to partition drives, it has a new name.

In addition to a Windows and a Linux partition, I have a Primary SparrowOS $FG,2$'D'$FG$, Backup SparrowOS $FG,2$'E'$FG$ and a Transfer $FG,2$'I'$FG$ partition for transferring between Windows and SparrowOS.  "hd0" is 1st hard drive, zero-based numbering. "msdos1" is partition #1, traditional msdos partitioning.  I keep $FG,2$'D'$FG$, $FG,2$'E'$FG$, and $FG,2$'I'$FG$ identical by frequently copying all files and I use $FG,2$'I'$FG$ to transfer files.  They only need to be a couple Gig in size.  Every time I copy files, use $LK,"InstallBoot","MN:InstallBoot"$() to $LK,"MakeAll","MN:MakeAll"$ and prepare the partition $LK,"boot sector","FI:::/SparrowOS/Adam/Boot/BootHD.CPP.Z"$ for chainloading by patching the new block address and size of $FG,2$OSMain.BIN.C$FG$.

menuentry "SparrowOS D" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd0,msdos1)
	chainloader +1
}

menuentry "SparrowOS E" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd0,msdos5)
	chainloader +1
}

menuentry "SparrowOS I" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd1,msdos5)
	chainloader +1
}
