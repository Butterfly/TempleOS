$TR,"DIRECTORY STRUCTURE"$
$ID,2$
$FG,2$/SparrowOS/Accts$FG$ Each subdirectory is an acct.  When you boot, you can select an acct to login to, unless you compile OSMain soas to pick one.  Your acct directory is your $FG,2$HOME$FG$ directory and all your user data should be placed in here to ease backing-up your data.  When you Install an application it will create a subdirectory of your $FG,2$HOME$FG$ directory for storage.

$FG,2$/SparrowOS/Apps$FG$ Applications are placed in subdirectories of $FG,2$/SparrowOS/Apps$FG$.  Applications should have a file called $FG,2$Install.CPP.Z$FG$ which will install the app for the current user acct.  The file, $FG,2$Load.CPP.Z$FG$ will load the application into mem.  The file, $FG,2$Run.CPP.Z$FG$, will usually load and execute the app.  To add an app to your personal menu, use $FG,2$<CTRL-L>$FG$, insert a macro with the PopUp option checked and invoke the $FG,2$Run.CPP.Z$FG$ file.

$FG,2$/SparrowOS/Demo$FG$ Here you can find lots of sample code to do various things.

$FG,2$/SparrowOS/Doc$FG$ Here you can find documentation.

$FG,2$/SparrowOS/OSMain$FG$ The core of the operating system is found here.  Since priviledge levels are not used, calling it a "kernel" would be confusing, but that's what it is.  It is statically compiled by $LK,"InstallBoot","MN:InstallBoot"$().  It is loaded by the boot loader and must fit in 640K.

$FG,2$/SparrowOS/Compiler$FG$ The compiler module src code is found here.  The compiler is statically compiled to produce a binary file which is loaded at boot.  It is also statically compiled by $LK,"InstallBoot","MN:InstallBoot"$().

$FG,2$/SparrowOS/Adam$FG$ The non-kernel part of the operating system is found here.  It is JIT compiled during boot.

$FG,2$/0000Boot$FG$ directory and the $FG,2$0000OSMain.BIN.C$FG$ file are named so that they are first in alphabetical order and, therefore, at a predictable CD/DVD block address.  The $LK,"CD/DVD Boot Loader","FI:::/SparrowOS/Adam/Boot/BootCD.CPP.Z"$ will find $FG,2$0000OSMain.BIN.C$FG$ at $LK,"Block #0x16","MN:CDBootFileCreate"$.  The SparrowOS boot loader can be used with $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"http://www.magiciso.com","http://www.magiciso.com"$$FG$ if you place $FG,2$0000OSMain.BIN.C$FG$ in the right spot.  $FG,2$OldMBR.BIN.C$FG$ and $FG,2$BootMHD2.BIN.C$FG$ will be found in $FG,2$/0000Boot$FG$ if you run $LK,"InstallMasterBoot","MN:InstallMasterBoot"$() to install a hard-drive master boot loader.

$ID,-2$$TR,"DOLLAR SIGN CMDS"$
$ID,2$
$LK,"Dollar Sign Cmds","FI:::/SparrowOS/Doc/Dollar.TXT.Z"$ are rich-text cmds.  The editor, compiler, assembler and operating system are seamlessly equiped to handle SparrowOS rich text.  Cmds like $LK,"Dir","MN:Dir"$() and $LK,"Grep","MN:Grep"$() can output links to the cmd line.

$ID,-2$$TR,"CMD PROMPT"$
$ID,2$
The SparrowOS cmd line interface is based on C/C++. Explore the ".CPP.Z" files.  A cmd which takes no args may be executed by typing the name and a semicolon.  Cmds with args require placing the arg in parentheses like a function call.

$MA,"Dir(\"*\");"$ will list files in the current directory.

$MA,"Dir;"$ uses default of "*".

$MA,"Cd(\"::/SparrowOS/Apps\");"$ will change directories.

Directories are referenced with "/" not "\".  The Boot drive is referred to with "$FG,2$::$FG$".  Other drives are referred to by a letter and a colon.  Your user acct directory is referred to with "$FG,2$HOME$FG$".

If a file is not found in one directory, all it's parents are searched. 

$FG,9$Ed("FILENAME.TXT.Z");$FG$ Invokes the editor. See $LK,"DOC LINK TYPES","MN:LK_FILE"$.


Some cmds like $LK,"Grep","MN:Grep"$() take a "find_files_mask".  They begin with the name of a dir tree and end with a list of filename masks.  See $LK,"FilesFindMatch","MN:FilesFindMatch"$().

$FG,9$Grep("pattern","/SparrowOS/Demo/*.CPP.Z;*.TXT.Z;");$FG$

Be aware of $LK,"TEXT_FILE_MASK","MN:TEXT_FILE_MASK"$ and $LK,"SRC_FILE_MASK","MN:SRC_FILE_MASK"$.

$ID,-2$$TR,"BURNING CD-ROMs/DVDs"$

1) Use $LK+S,"CDFileCreate","MN:CDFileCreate"$() to make an ISO image file.
